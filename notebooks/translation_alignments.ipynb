    "Once installed, the Cylleneus engine can be used in conjunction with the CLTK and other libraries to perform queries programmatically via the search API. In this way, the engine can be used in the service of text analysis. One use could be to query and manipulate so-called \"translation alignments\", where the translation of some Latin or Greek text is linked with the primary-language source text, supporting research in classical reception or translation studies. Let's see what we can do!\n",

    "That's better. But by now we must be wondering: what word or words in Greek is English 'sword' translating? There are, after all, at least three Greek words corresponding to this meaning: *ξίφος*, *ἄορ*, and *φάσγανον* (there is also *ῥομφαία*, but that is more like a 'broadsword' and at any rate is a late word). Does Homer use all three for 'sword'? We can use our translation alignment, along with a primary source text, to explore the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "*ἄορ* is intriguing. It occurs in the *Odyssey* as a clear synonym of *ξίφος* and can be substituted for it in similar formulaic expressions (cf. 10.294, *σὺ ξίφος ὀξὺ ἐρυσσάμενος παρὰ μηροῦ* with 11.24, *ἐγὼ δ᾽ ἄορ ὀξὺ ἐρυσσάμενος παρὰ μηροῦ*).

    "In the first case, 'sword' actually occurs as part of the translation of *χρυσάορος*, an epithet of Apollo (\"golden-sword'd\"): a part-of-speech mismatch. In the third, 'swords' translates *ξιφέεσσιν*, which should have been counted amongst the matches for that word. For some reason, however, it was not correctly lemmatized. The remaining occurrence is more revealing. It reminds us that *χαλκός* (like Latin *ferrum*) can also, by a kind of metonymy, have the sense of 'sword'. This is a case, then, where the translator has \"flattened\" the sense of the source text, replacing the figurative expression with a more prosaic one. It is also a case in which the translator has interpreted a generic term -- in addition to 'sword', we know that *χαλκός* (literally, 'bronze') can also cover the meaning of 'spear', 'knife', 'axe', or even 'armor' -- in a more specialized sense. Of course, Cylleneus can't explain why that choice was made. But it has helped us identify some interesting features of Murray's translation."
